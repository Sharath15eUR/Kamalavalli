Linux History
Linus Torvalds designed the free and open-source Linux operating system kernel in 1991. Torvalds set out to develop a free and flexible system for personal computers, drawing ideas from the UNIX operating system and the MINIX operating system. Teamwork in development was encouraged with the initial release of the Linux kernel, which attracted developers and enthusiasts globally quickly. Various open-source software packages integrated with the Linux kernel created fully operational operating systems, occasionally referred to as Linux distributions.

Over the years, Linux has become known as a key component of modern computing, powering everything from servers and personal computers to supercomputers and smartphones.
